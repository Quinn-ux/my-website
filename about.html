           <p class="para">Quincy are a spiritually aware <span style="color: blue;"><a href="#">Humans</span></a> who possess the ability to manipulate  <span style="color: blue;"><a href="#">Reishi</span></a> to accomplish a<br>multitude of feats. As such, their powers are considered unnatural by other beings, namely the  <span style="color: blue;"><a href="#">Shinigami</span></a>, who<br>believe that their power to destroy an hollow soul upsets the balance of the world. It is for this reason that Shinigami and<br>Quincy are often compatred to oil and water in that the two are polar opposites, this has lead to a multitude of conflicts over<br>the centuries with the Shinigami</p>
